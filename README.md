## üìå Description
This programming exercise is designed to develop proficiency in data manipulation using the Python programming language and the pandas library within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The task involves loading a car dataset from a CSV file, performing exploratory data analysis, and extracting specific information through subsetting, slicing, and indexing techniques.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook
- Install pandas if not already installed.
- Download the required CSV (bit.ly/Cars_file)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Save the CSV in your default user folder
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the folder with your .py files
4. Run the scripts using:
   - *python SAEZ_Pandas-P1.py*
   - *python SAEZ_Pandas-P2.py*

## üí° Examples w/ Explanation

### 01 üß† Problem 1

```python

#a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
#b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.
import pandas as pd #import pandas library

cars = pd.read_csv("cars.csv") #load the .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
p1 = pd.concat([cars.head(), cars.tail()]) #display the first 5 rows and last 5 rows of cars.csv
p1

```

#### Code Explanation:

- cars = pd.read_csv("cars.csv") ‚Üí loads the dataset cars.csv into a Pandas DataFrame named cars.
- cars.head() ‚Üí returns the first 5 rows of the dataset.
- cars.tail() ‚Üí returns the last 5 rows of the dataset.
- pd.concat([...]) ‚Üí combines both sets of rows into a single DataFrame.
- The result is stored in a new DataFrame called p1


### 02 üßÆ Problem 2

```python

import pandas as pd  # Import the pandas library
cars = pd.read_csv("cars.csv")  # Load the .csv file into a DataFrame named cars

```
 dataset cars.csv ‚Üí read and stored in a DataFrame called cars.

```python

cars.iloc[:, ::2].head()

```
- .iloc[:, ::2] ‚Üí selects all rows (:) but only every 2nd column starting from the first one (::2).
- .head() ‚Üí shows the first 5 rows of those selected columns.
  

```python

cars.loc[cars['Model'] == 'Mazda RX4']

```
- .loc[...] ‚Üí  used to filter rows.

- This returns the rows where the Model column is exactly 'Mazda RX4'.
  

```python

cars.loc[cars['Model'] == 'Camaro Z28', ['Model', 'cyl']]

```
- Filters the DataFrame for rows where Model = 'Camaro Z28'.

- Returns only the Model and cyl (cylinders) columns.

```python

models = (...)

```
- Creates a tuple containing the car models you want to filter.

```python

cars['Model'].isin(models)

```

- Checks if each row‚Äôs Model is one of the values in the tuple.

- Returns True for matching rows, False otherwise.


```python


cars.loc[..., ['Model','cyl','gear']]

```

- .loc[...] ‚Üí selects the rows where the condition is True.

- ['Model','cyl','gear'] ‚Üí specifies which columns to return.
